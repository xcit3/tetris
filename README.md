So, this is a Tetris clone i made in year 10 as a fun project. While rotating isn't avaliable, everything else should work fine and pieces will spawn in a random rotation. 
Uses bag randomisation to ensure that duplicate pieces are never more than 14 pieces apart. Has a 'next up' and score tracker on the side. Controls are arrow keys.
Note: I know the actual coding practices are very, very bad, but it was something that I figured I'd put here regardless since despite that it still works (for the most part).
