So, this is a Tetris clone i made in year 10 as a fun project. While rotating isn't avaliable, everything else should work fine and pieces will spawn in a random rotation. 
Uses bag randomisation to ensure that duplicate pieces are never more than 14 pieces apart. Has a 'next up' and score tracker on the side. Controls are arrow keys.
Note: I know the actual coding practices are very, very bad, but it was something that I figured I'd put here regardless since despite that it still works (for the most part).
Same thing goes for variable names and extremely inefficient code that could easily be fixed in a number of ways; I was in year 10 and was just working on it for fun.
